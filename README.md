# A deep learning framework
This project implements a *deep learning framework* using only pytorch Tensors. In particular, we implemented forward and backward passes for the MSE loss and for the most common operations used within a neural network, e.g. fully connected layer, ReLU activation. The the framework is versatile and easy to understand which allow to easily develop additional features.

Folders and files:
- `hotgrad/`: folder containing our deep learning framework.
- `dataset_generator.py`: function used to generate a simple 2D dataset.
- `test.py`: tests the neural network implemented with our library and shows the accurancy.
- `Report.pdf`: report explaining our approach and implemenation of the deep learning library.

We suggest to read the report for a detalied description of the library.
